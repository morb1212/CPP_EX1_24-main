# Graph Algorithms

This C++ project provides implementations of various graph algorithms, including connectivity checks, shortest path finding, cycle detection, and bipartite graph identification.

## Project Details

## Overview

The project consists of two main classes:

- **Graph**: Represents a graph data structure and provides methods for loading graphs from adjacency matrices and printing graph information.
- **Algorithms**: Contains static methods for performing graph algorithms on instances of the `Graph` class.

## Implemented Algorithms

1. **Connectivity Check**: Determines whether a graph is connected.
2. **Shortest Path**: Finds the shortest path between two vertices in a graph.
3. **Cycle Detection**: Identifies whether a graph contains a cycle.
4. **Bipartite Graph Identification**: Determines whether a graph is bipartite and if so, partitions the vertices into two sets.

## Usage

To use this project:

1. **Include Header Files**: Include the `Graph.hpp` and `Algorithms.hpp` header files in your C++ project.
2. **Instantiate Graph Objects**: Create instances of the `Graph` class and load graphs using the `loadGraph` method.
3. **Use Algorithm Methods**: Call the static methods of the `Algorithms` class to perform various graph algorithms on the loaded graph objects.
